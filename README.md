# Task Tracker App
### Christina Elias

## Description
This is my second attempt at creating a task tracker app that allows users to access pre-existing tasks stored in a JSON file, then add/check off/delete tasks in the DOM as they need, with the changes reflected on the backend.

## Process
I never would have been able to complete this project with the help of a tutorial and a lot of other resources. Going into it, I had almost no idea what we were even asked to do in terms of the backend, but I think after following tutorials, doing research and building this out and playing with the code, I feel like I learned so much more than I might have just reading about CRUD and Express routes and trying to sense of it all in my head. I still have a lot more research and practice to do before I feel confident in these concepts.

This was approached with the front-end first : HTML and CSS first, following by the functionality and back-end. 

I found it especially helpful how the tutorial I followed organized code in a similar way to the Mapty Udemy tutorial we coded along with for a G.I., using a class and constructor method for the client-side JS. One of my goals going forward in the program is to get more used to building and working with that architecture.

## Challenges/Errors
Talk through what challenges you faces and how you handled errors here.

The most difficult part about this project was making sure I understood the process, the code, and how each file/set of code interacted with another. I also read up on a bit of introductory jQuery for this project, which was completely new to me, but which I found really interesting.

One error I ran into was when, while messing around with the client-side JS, I broke the code and wasn't sure what I did. After messing with what had once been perfectly working code, I could no longer check off or delete the tasks, so it was challenging going back and trying to figure out where I went wrong, which ended up being mostly syntax errors.

Overall, I'm grateful for the learning process from this project.
